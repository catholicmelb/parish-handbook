# Foreword

As members of the community of the Church, we are called to live the gospel in our own lives and share the message of Christ with the wider community. To do this, we need to make good use of all the gifts God has given. Among these are the material resources at our disposal. For each parish, the responsibility for the good management of the community’s resources lies with the Parish Priest or Administrator, with the assistance of the Parish Finance Committee.
 
The release of this new handbook coincides with ongoing renewal in the Church concerning the need for the highest standards in financial accountability and management of risks.
 
This handbook contains administrative and finance related policies and guidance for the [Arch]diocese of [Melbourne].  They are designed to assist parishes in the various aspects of parish administration and provide confidence to parishioners, committee members and clergy alike that parish goods are well administered.
 
The statutes, policies and guidelines should be followed throughout the Archdiocese to promote the proper administration of parish resources. I trust that the handbook will be a valuable tool for priests and parishes in administering goods that have been entrusted to them.
 
I would like to emphasise the essential role of the Parish Finance Committee. Such a committee is required by general Church law. It is necessary so that priest and people might work together responsibly in the overall mission of the local Church.
 
I commend this handbook as an excellent resource to assist in the leadership and administration of the parish.
