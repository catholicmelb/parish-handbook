# 1. Overview

## Aim

The aim of this *Handbook* is to provide all parishes throughout the Archdiocese of Melbourne with guidelines on parish administration and management, including the administration of parish goods. These guidelines should be viewed as a minimum for each parish to follow.

Guidelines should be read in conjunction with the Parish Finance Committee Statutes of the Archdiocese of Melbourne and the *Code of Canon Law*.

## Church and civil law

The Church operates in two spheres: the church sphere and the civil sphere. Each sphere has its particular legislation. In the church sphere, it is the canons of the *Code of Canon Law*. In the civil sphere, it is the legal code of the Commonwealth and state governments. At times, the requirements of these laws can be the same; however, on other occasions, there are significant differences between the two.
