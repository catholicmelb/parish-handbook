# 1. Overview

## 1.1 Aim

The aim of this Handbook is to provide all parishes throughout the Archdiocese of Melbourne with guidelines on parish administration and management, including the administration of parish goods. These guidelines should be viewed as a minimum for each parish to follow.

They should be read in conjunction with the Parish Finance Committee Statutes of the Archdiocese of Melbourne and the Code of Canon Law

## 1.2 Church & Civil Law

The Church operates in two spheres. The first, the church sphere, and the second the Commonwealth and State governmental sphere. Each sphere has its particular legislation. In the church sphere, it is the canons of The Code of Canon law. In the Commonwealth and State government spheres, it is civil law.  At times the requirements of these laws can be the same; however, on other occasions, there are significant differences between the two.
