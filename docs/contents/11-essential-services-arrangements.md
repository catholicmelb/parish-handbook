# 11. Other Catholic agencies

## Catholic Mission

Catholic Mission, as the Australian agency of the Pontifical Mission Societies, contributes funding and provides project support to critical Church-run initiatives in Africa, Asia, Oceania and South America, as well as remote dioceses within Australia.

Catholic Mission creates opportunities for people to be formed in mission and to respond through prayer, fundraising and action, inspiring them to reach out and give life, within Australia and around the world.

For further information regarding Catholic Mission, including contact details for the local diocesan director, please refer to the [Catholic Mission website](https://www.catholicmission.org.au/for-parishes).

## Caritas

Caritas is the Catholic Church’s international aid and development agency in Australia.

Caritas began in Australia in 1962 as the Catholic Church Relief Fund (CCRF), which became the Catholic Overseas Relief Committee in 1964. In 1996, the agency became Caritas Australia.

Today Caritas serves in 18 countries, working through 67 partnerships in communities to bring hope, support and compassion to the world’s most vulnerable people.

For further information regarding Caritas, including details of the Archdiocese’s local Caritas director, please refer to the [Caritas Australia website](https://www.caritas.org.au/contact/).

## Catholic Super

Catholic Super is the default superannuation fund for the Archdiocese and parishes. The Archdiocese’s Parish Payroll Service attends to the onboarding of new employees and administration of the regular employer SGC contributions—whether to Catholic Super or other funds nominated by employees.

For further details regarding Catholic Super, including the advisory services they offer parish employees, please refer to the [Catholic Super website](https://csf.com.au/employers/catholic-super-employers).

## St Vincent de Paul

The St Vincent de Paul Society’s members and volunteers provide practical support, advocacy and friendship to the most vulnerable in our community. This is done through local conferences, most often with significant parish and parishioner support.
