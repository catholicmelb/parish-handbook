## Development and Philanthropy Office

The Archdiocese’s Development and Philanthropy Office (DPO) was formed to enhance and support the fundraising efforts of the Archbishop, diocesan parishes and key Church agencies. In the context of parishes, the DPO's services include:

* **offertory giving programs**\
  These programs are designed to educate parishioners on the importance of giving to the parish on a weekly basis. DPO resources particularly focus on encouraging parishioners to see their act of gift-giving as part of the offertory made at the Mass. Parishes should run an offertory giving program at least once every three years; and, once a year, on a particular weekend of their choice, parishes are also encouraged to provide parishioners with an opportunity to reflect on their giving habits and re-evaluate their weekly pledge.
* **capital campaigns**\
  From time to time, parishes need to embark on special fundraising campaigns known as capital campaigns. The DPO will closely collaborate with parish priests and with finance and building committees to plan out a scheduled and detailed fundraising program. This will include formulating a strong case for support and carrying out or aiding conversations with prospective donor families.
* **bequests promotion**\
  Bequests are powerful and transformational acts of generosity. Naturally one of the most important communities in many people’s lives is their local parish. On many occasions, through the provision of a will, the Church has received deceased estates, or portions of an individual’s estate. The DPO can talk to priests about how to go about promoting bequests.
* **Melbourne Catholic Professionals (MCP)**\
  The DPO organises MCP luncheons throughout the year, providing opportunities for parishioners from various business sectors to meet with the Archbishop and network with other Catholic professionals. Guests at MCP events enjoy hearing from guest speakers who share powerful testimonies of working in different professions.

For further information on the above programs and for any other fundraising enquiries, please contact the Philanthropy and Development Office on (03) 9926 5771 or via email at [archbishopsfund@cam.org.au](mailto:archbishopsfund@cam.org.au).

### **The Archbishop’s Campaign**

The Archbishop’s Campaign is an annual campaign that takes place in parishes over three weekends in August, raising money for the tax-deductible Archbishop’s Charitable Fund and the non-tax-deductible Religious Projects Fund. Monies raised for the Archbishop’s Charitable Fund are distributed to the Priest’s Retirement Foundation, Corpus Christi Building Fund, University of Divinity Building Fund, Melbourne Overseas Mission, John Pierce Centre and, through an annual grants program, other Catholic social and community agencies. Monies raised for the Religious Projects Fund support seminarian education and evangelisation initiatives of the Archdiocese. The Archbishop’s Campaign first ran in 2024 and incorporated what were previously separate Sunday special collections in order to streamline fundraising efforts in parishes. 

## Priests Retirement Foundation

The Priests Retirement Foundation (the Foundation) was established in 1990 and contributes to the ongoing care of retired priests across the Archdiocese of Melbourne. This includes, but is not limited to, the provision of suitable accommodation, health care and medical out-of-pocket expenses.

The Foundation runs an annual appeal on the first Sunday of September, Father’s Day.

For further information regarding the Foundation, refer to the [Priests Retirement Foundation web page ](https://melbournecatholic.org/foundation)on the Melbourne Catholic website.

## <span id="#priests-remuneration-fund">Priests’ Remuneration Fund</span>

The Priests’ Remuneration Fund (PRF) operates an ‘equalisation’ fund to ensure all priests in the Archdiocese of Melbourne receive the designated minimum level of support.

The PRF emerged from revelations in the late 1960s that many priests were living in strained circumstances, sustained solely by what came in on the collection plate. Due to economic unevenness across the Archdiocese, priests in wealthy parishes were guaranteed a comfortable living while their brother priests in poorer areas were often consigned to decades of struggle.

A series of clergy-initiated proposals to correct this imbalance were accepted and implemented in 1969 by Archbishop Knox.

In 1997, Archbishop Pell proclaimed the charter of the PRF and constituted it as a public juridical person under canon law.

For further details regarding the PRF, refer to the Archdiocese’s [PRF guidelines](https://www.camclergy.org.au/prf-guidelines).

## Proclaim: The Office for Mission Renewal

Proclaim: The Office for Mission Renewal was established in early 2020 to support the life of the Archdiocese of Melbourne in our aim to strive for ‘the missionary option’ in all we do. We heed Pope Francis’ words in *Evangelii Gaudium* to seek ‘a missionary impulse capable of transforming everything, so that the Church’s customs, ways of doing things, times and schedules, language and structures can be suitably channelled for the evangelisation of today’s world’ (§27).

The Proclaim team seeks to work with, inspire and empower parishes and local communities to proclaim and live the joy of the Gospel, offering them a range of strategies, resources and support, including:

* accompanying clergy and parish leadership teams to discern pathways towards missionary renewal and growing parishes that are vital, vibrant and equipped to effectively spread the Gospel in their neighbourhoods and beyond, particularly as the Archdiocese continues the *Take the Way of the Gospel* journey
* supporting parishes to grow communities of married couples, families, and youth and young people, following Jesus' example of encountering and shaping disciples into the new life they were called into. Nurturing a culture of vocations in our local communities is a key component of discipleship. Parishes can also connect university students with our vibrant network of campus ministries
* providing parishes with publications and catechetical resources for adult faith formation, liturgy, prayer, initiation, and social justice and ecology. The team also oversees the *To Know, Worship and Love* religious education texts for Catholic schools
* connecting parishes Aboriginal Catholic Ministry (ACM), a vibrant ministry that provides support, pastoral and spiritual care to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, educates the wider community and works towards achieving real and lasting reconciliation.
