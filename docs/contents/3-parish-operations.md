## 3.1 Transaction and investment accounts

### 3.1.1 Establishing accounts

Unless there is good reason for not doing so, all parish transaction and investment accounts are to be held with the Catholic Development Fund. *All accounts, whether held with CDF or external banks, must be incorporated into a parish’s accounting system so that a complete consolidated record of income, expenditure and total funds available is maintained.*

There are limited circumstances where it is not possible for a parish to maintain all accounts with the CDF. For example, a parish in receipt of government grant funding may have a contractual obligation to hold the funds with an approved deposit-taking institution (ADI). In this instance, the parish would be required to open an external bank account. The lack of a local NAB branch would not be a good reason for opening a non-CDF account, as the CDF has arrangements available through Australia Post and other NAB solutions to cater for cash-handling and access requirements. 

Each parish with a priest receiving the stipend shall have at least two transactional accounts as follows:

1. **\[Name of parish] Church Account**
2. **\[Name of parish] Presbytery Account**.

Other accounts might include:

3. **\[Name of parish] Priests Car Capital Allowance Account**\
   Priests responsible for their own vehicles (those who are not members of the Priests Car Pool) are to access the benefit of the prescribed car capital allowance via a parish account established for this purpose. The allowance may accumulate until the priest purchases a new vehicle. Funds held in the Car Capital Allowance Account must be directed to the vehicle supplier by the parish for the exempt benefit rules to apply. Payment of allowances to a priest directly will incur PAYGW tax obligations.
4. **\[Name of parish] Investment Account**\
   Term investment accounts should be maintained for the holding funds surplus to the parish’s immediate operational needs as follows: Parishes with more than one Mass centre are to make arrangements with each Mass centre to deposit their income into the parish church account. Likewise, expenditure for each Mass centre will be made from the same parish church account. The parish’s accounting package should be used to keep records of the income and costs attributable to Mass centres rather than maintaining multiple church accounts.

Accounts for the following activities may be kept separately from the church account; however, parishes are encouraged to keep additional accounts to a minimum: 

* bingo, fete and general fundraising
* religious instruction
* social committee and functions
* commercial property rental, church/hall building hire
* commercial operations such as retirement villages, early learning centres.

### 3.1.2 Account signatories

All parish accounts, except for the presbytery account, are to each have a minimum of three (3) signatories and transactions must be approved by any two signatories. Presbytery account transactions may be signed by the parish priest solely.

The parish priest must be a designated signatory for all parish accounts. The parish priest is the ‘authorising party’ for any changes to account signing authorities.

Ordinarily, the parish priest and one other signatory would authorise each payment transaction. It is recommended the other two signatories include the chairperson and treasurer of the parish finance committee. Parish employees may be included as an account signatory. 

Signatories should be reviewed and updated annually.

The parish priest is permitted to renew term investments and to authorise redemptions of term investments to the church account solely.

It is recommended signatories be appointed by the parish priest after informing the parish finance committee.

### 3.1.3 Recording transactions

For recording and reporting purposes, income and expenditure through *all parish operating and investment accounts*(excluding presbytery account income and expenditure) must be fully recorded and reported in the parish’s accounting package. This is to ensure all financial resources available to the parish are clearly identified and proper governance applied.

The Archdiocese has published a standard chart of accounts to be used by all parishes. Refer to **Appendix 2: Standard Chart of Accounts**

While the detailed income and expenditure of the presbytery account is not included in the parish’s financial reports, the GST incurred on presbytery expenditures is generally eligible to be included in the parish’s BAS return. Note that GST incurred on a priest’s personal expenditures relating to entertainment, recreation, holidays and meals is not eligible to be claimed as an input tax credit. GST incurred on pastoral related expenditures, vehicle running costs, subscriptions, formation and training, and similar costs is eligible for claiming as an input tax credit. GST refunded by the ATO to the parish relating to presbytery expenditures should be transferred back to the presbytery account. The same tax invoice retention requirements that apply to claiming GST by the parish also apply to substantiating GST claimed on presbytery expenses. The parish priest should ensure these documents are retained and made available to the parish in the event of an ATO GST audit.

### 3.3.2 Presbytery expenditure

Payments from the presbytery account include:

* levies and cathedraticum, calculated on the total gross receipts paid into the presbytery account, as specified in section 3.3.1, *excluding Mass offerings*

  * cathedraticum of 5 per cent for the Archbishop to the Archdiocese Finance Office
  * contribution of 12.5 per cent to the Priests’ Remuneration Fund
  * contribution of 12.5 per cent to the Priests’ Retirement Foundation
* normal household expenses, including food, hospitality, housekeeper salary
* diocesan car capital allowance as per **Appendix 3: Active Clergy Remuneration Schedule**
* regular supply fees to augment Sunday Masses provided by the parish priest as per **Appendix 4: Schedule of Stipends—Supply Priests**.

After all these payments have been allocated, the diocesan minimum living allowance is paid from the presbytery account to the priest(s) of the parish, as either cash or exempt benefits.
