# 2. Principles of parish administration

## 2.1 General Principles

### 2.1.1 The Person in Charge of Administration

The general principle is that the Bishop is responsible for the administration of a diocese, and the Parish Priest is responsible for the administration of a parish.  The Bishop may entrust the administration of the parish to another person who is not a Priest, but must appoint a priest to be ultimately responsible for the pastoral care of the parish.  

The Bishop is responsible for administering the goods belonging to the diocese while the Parish Administrator is responsible for those belonging to the parish.  

The Bishop is to supervise carefully the administration of all the goods which belong to the parishes, and to ensure the effective administration of church goods by issuing Parish Finance Committee Statutes.

### 2.1.2 Summary of Canons and Respective Roles

It is the responsibility of the Bishop to supervise carefully the administration of all goods that belong to parishes of the Diocese (canon 1276, §1).

In attending to this responsibility, the Bishop issues special instructions for administration of church goods and property (canon 1276, §2).  

The parish priest is the administrator of the assets of the parish (canon 532).  He is to carry out this task of administration in accord with the norms of canons 1281-1288.  In place of a parish priest, the Bishop may appoint a parish administrator.  All the financial responsibilities of a parish priest apply equally to parish administrators, with the proviso that no changes take place, which would prejudice the rights of a subsequently appointed parish priest.  References to parish priests in this Handbook, includes reference to parish administrators where appointed.

Canon 537 makes it obligatory that there be a finance committee in each parish to assist the parish priest in regard to his responsibilities for financial and administrative matters.

The existence of the finance committee does not detract from the parish priest’s standing as the one who acts in the name of the parish (canon 532).  However, such a Committee provides the parish priest with valuable insight and advice, so that he may act more effectively in the interests of the parish.

Careful adherence to any instructions issued by the Archbishop is required by parish priests and finance committees. If Diocesan policy and Canon Law requirements are not complied with, a particular transaction may be invalid under Canon Law and possibly under civil law as well.

There are certain situations where Canon Law, through the norms issued by the local bishop, requires a parish priest to consult with and obtain the advice of the Parish Finance Committee (PFC).  The parish priest is not bound in any way to accept the Committee’s advice, even if unanimous; nevertheless, there must be some overriding reason for not doing so.

## 2.2 Acts of Parish Administration

### 2.2.1 Canon Law Summary

The Church holds and administers temporal goods to serve the mission that the Lord has entrusted to the Church.  The first point, which should be kept in mind, therefore, is that Church property never belongs to an individual person as if it were his or her own personal property.  Church property always belongs to some juridic person and is the concern of the Christian community.  

The canonical norms, therefore, structure the Church’s administration of property to facilitate the Church’s mission, to protect the rights of various Christian communities to the proper use of property entrusted to them and to promote the welfare of those persons and groups who should benefit from the wise use of the goods, which are made available to the Church

Canon law states four broad purposes for Church property:
• pursuit of divine worship;
• support for clerics and other ministers;
• performance of the apostolic works proper to the Church; and
• works of charity, especially concern for the needy (c.1254, §2).

Canon Law distinguishes two types of acts of administration in relation to parishes:
• acts of ordinary administration, and
• acts of extraordinary administration.

In addition, there are specific Canon Law requirements in relation to:
• the alienation (transfer of ownership) of property, and
• the leasing out of parish goods.

### 2.2.2 Ordinary Administration

Acts of ordinary administration are transactions and expenditures considered necessary for the daily and routine operation and maintenance of the property or work of the parish.  This can include the following:

• Maintenance of church buildings;
• Payment of salaries and taxes;
• Acceptance of ordinary donations;
• Replacement of equipment and furniture and
• Collection of debts, rents and interest.

The parish priest (incl. administrator) does not require authorisation, or the advice or consent of others (e.g. Parish Finance Committee or Bishop) to carry out such acts.  However, with some decisions he may choose to seek advice from the Parish Finance Committee.  

### 2.2.3 Extraordinary Administration

Acts that are not acts of ordinary administration are considered to be acts of extraordinary administration.  These acts require the parish priest to consult with the Parish Finance Committee and seek the Bishop’s approval before proceeding.

All correspondence to the Archbishop or the Diocesan Executive Director Stewardship’s office relating to consultations with, or the work of, the Parish Finance Committee must be signed by the Parish Priest.

The Archbishop has determined in accordance with canon 1281, §2, that the acts listed below are acts of extraordinary administration:

• Capital works and major refurbishment on a single project expenditure exceeding $100,000 for Parish projects and Primary School projects and $300,000 for Secondary Colleges must be submitted to the Archbishop for his approval through the Planning, Building & Finance Committee.  (Note that Melbourne Archdiocese Catholic Schools Ltd will submit the requests for approval of primary school and college projects).
\[new]
• Sale & purchase of land;
• Other acts of alienation of a parish’s stable patrimony (property & fixed assets) where the value (not the sale price) is above the minimum amount published in the norms issued by the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference.  As at June 2022, acts of alienation in excess of $33,921 require the approval of the Archbishop;
• Leasing of property and buildings for terms greater than 3 years;
• Adopting an “indemnity only” basis for insurance of parish buildings (ie: insurance cover is limited to the cost of removal / demolition of the insured building)
• Formation of any civil incorporation, or participation in any civil incorporation other than the “Roman Catholic Trusts Corporation for the Diocese of Melbourne”;
• Initiating or contesting litigation in a civil forum in the name of a public juridic person (Parish or Archdiocese);
• Acceptance or refusal of bequests to which are attached some qualifying obligation or condition;
• Any borrowings outside of CDF & any borrowings with CDF >$100,000; and
• Establishing investments of parish reserves > $100,000 outside of CDF.

For the above acts the parish priest must first consult the members of the Parish Finance Committee.  The parish priest must ensure the members are fully informed before convening the Committee.

Following consultation with the Parish Finance Committee, the parish priest must seek written permission from the Archbishop for such acts of Extraordinary Administration.  The opinion of the Committee must be relayed to Archbishop in the request for permission.

Before the Archbishop provides written approval, he may be required to seek the advice of the College of Consultors and/or the Diocesan Finance Committee.

### 2.2.4 Alienation

Alienation, simply defined, is the transfer of assets or rights over assets from one person to another with or without compensation.  Normally, this will be through the sale or gifting of assets.  Acts such as mortgaging, renting, or leasing of property are not acts of alienation, however, these transactions themselves may constitute acts of extraordinary administration and therefore require consent and approvals as noted above. The concept behind alienation, is that goods constituting the stable patrimony of the parish (ie: of the juridic person) are destined to remain in the possession of the church for a long or indefinite period of time, in order to provide security for the future through the preservation of value (canon 1294 §1 & §2).

A typical example would involve the sale of property and investment of the sale proceeds. Additionally, interest earned on the investment should be reinvested (to the value of inflation) so as to maintain the real value of the asset.  If the purchasing value is not maintained against inflation, it cannot be said that the future benefit has been preserved.  Utilisation of sale proceeds of a property should not be applied to the general maintenance of other properties, as distinctions between items of capital (assets and liabilities) and revenue (income and expenses) need to be drawn.

This is not to say that permission to utilise the proceeds will be unreasonably withheld, providing it can be demonstrated that the capital is being converted into another asset.

It is the Archdiocese’s policy that the proceeds from the sale of real property and long term investment assets, not otherwise applied to purchase replacement assets, be lodged with the Catholic Development Fund.  Investment of sale proceeds outside of the CDF require the permission of the Archbishop in accordance with the prescribed norms in the PFC Statutes.  The purchase of replacement assets may constitute an act of extraordinary administration thus requiring its own approval per section 2.2.3 Extraordinary Administration

It is most important that the intentions of the donors of goods to the parish are respected when a decision is made to alienate such goods (canon 1300).  It may be prudent to consult with the donor, or their representative(s) to ensure their original bequest/donation intentions are not contravened.

Specific permissions are required whenever the value of goods being alienated exceeds the sum determined by law (canon 1291). In November 1984 the Australian Catholic Bishops’ Conference determined the minimum and maximum sums in relation to alienation and confirmed that:
• Proposed acts of alienation by a parish in excess of the minimum sum require the Archbishop to obtain the consent of the Diocesan Finance Committee, the College of Consultors and other interested parties prior to giving permission for the alienation; and
• Where such proposed acts are in excess of the maximum sum, the Archbishop must also seek the permission of the Holy See (canon 1292, §2)

The minimum and maximum sums are indexed at 30 June each year in accordance with the Consumer Price Index.  For the current amounts refer to Appendix 1 - Amounts for alienation of temporal goods.

### 2.2.5 Leases

In November 1984 the Australian Catholic Bishops’ Conference further determined when the leasing out of parish assets required special permissions in accordance with Canon 1297:

• For leases for periods in excess of nine (9) years, the same permissions as for acts of extraordinary administration are required; and

• For leases for periods greater than three (3) years but less than nine (9) years, the parish priest/administrator requires the consent of the Archbishop after having consulted the Parish Finance Committee.   The Bishop may consult the Diocesan Finance Council and the College of Consultors.

In addition, the Archbishop has determined that for leases for periods of three (3) years or less that the parish priest must consult the Parish Finance Committee.  

### 2.2.6 Invalid Acts of Administration

Parish priests act invalidly if they perform acts of extraordinary administration without prior written permission of the Archbishop (canon 1281, §1).  Without this permission, the action is invalid at Canon Law and may also be invalid from a civil law standpoint.

## 2.3 Civil Law Obligations

### 2.3.1 Ownership of Property: Canonical v Civil
In civil law, all Catholic Church assets owned by the archdiocese or parishes are owned by the Archbishop under the title of the “Roman Catholic Trusts Corporation for the Diocese of Melbourne”, established as a body corporate under the Roman Catholic Trusts Act 1907. Physical Land Titles are held at the Archdiocesan Office.
 
Any formal legal transactions (ie: property transfers, lease agreements) of the archdiocese or of its parishes must take place under the seal of the Trustees of the Roman Catholic Trusts Corporation for the Diocese of Melbourne (the Trust Corporation).
 
In canon law, all parish assets are owned by the parish.
 
### 2.3.2 Australian Charities and Not-for-profit Commission (ACNC)
Parishes are to maintain current registration as a charity with the ACNC, and ensure local credentials are maintained to access the ACNC’s Charity Portal.  Parishes are to ensure details of the “Responsible Person” (solely the Parish Priest) are maintained through the portal.  
 
The Archdiocesan’ Parish Support Office is responsible for the bulk lodgement of the Annual Information Statement report for all parishes.  Parishes and the Archdiocesan Finance/Parish Support Office are to both have access to ACNC Portal records.
 
### 2.3.3 Australian Taxation Office (ATO)
Parishes are to maintain current registration as an Income Tax Exempt Charity with the ATO, and maintain local access to the ATO Business Portal.  The Archdiocesan Finance/Parish Support Office will also maintain separate access as an authorised contact on each parish’s ATO accounts.
 
Parishes are to maintain up to date records of local authorised ATO contact persons and comply with various taxation obligations including:
- Employee & Minister of Religion “Pay As You Go” Withholding Tax requirements;
- GST;
- Fringe Benefits Tax
 
Parishes serviced by the Archdiocesan Parish Payroll Service will have their ATO PAYGW obligations including Single Touch Payroll reporting requirements met via the automated lodgement process through the Hero Pay platform.

### 2.3.4 Employment of Staff
Parishes are required to observe the civil laws concerning labour and social policy (canon 1286 §1) including abiding by national employment standards and maintaining contracts of employment.  Canon law also requires parish priests to pay a just and decent wage (can 1287 §2).  
 
The Archdiocesan Parish Payroll Service and Human Resources Department can assist parishes in meeting these obligations.   See section 8.2​Archdiocesan Human Resources Office for further details.
 
### 2.3.5 Occupational Health & Safety
Victoria’s Building Regulations 2018 require building owners to maintain “essential safety measures” so that they operate satisfactorily. There are different obligations under the Regulations, which depend on when the building was built or when building work occurred on the building.
 
Refer to Section 11 Essential Services Arrangements for further details.
 
### 2.3.6 Safeguarding & Working With Children & Vulnerable People
Safeguarding is everyone's responsibility. The safety and wellbeing of all persons is considered our highest priority in the Archdiocese of Melbourne.  
 
The Archdiocese acknowledges that safeguarding children and vulnerable people requires proactive approaches across policies, procedures and practices within parishes, agencies and entities consistent with the requirements of the:
 
• Worker Screening Act 2020
• Child Safe Standards and the Reportable Conduct Scheme (Commission for Children and Young People, Victoria)
• National Principles for Child Safe Organisations (Australian Human Rights Commission)
• National Catholic Safeguarding Standards (Catholic Professional Standards Limited)
 
In fulfilling this responsibility, the Safeguarding Children and Young People Framework has been developed to guide the implementation of child safety policies, procedures and practices within parishes, agencies and entities with the aim of promoting the safety of children and young people.
 
Parishes are required to abide by the requirements of the Archdiocese’s policy for Safeguarding Children and Young People
 
People who are doing child-related work (and aren’t otherwise exempt under the Act) need a Working With Children Check. This applies to both paid and volunteer workers.  People who do not hold a valid Working With Children Check card, are legally prevented from performing child related work.  Contravention of this requirement is an offence with penalties attached for individuals of up to two years imprisonment or a fine of 240 penalty units ($44,380 at July 2022) or both.  Body corporates face fines of up to 1,200 penalty units ($221,904 at July 2022).
 
Refer to Section 7.3 Safeguarding Protections of the Handbook for further details of parish obligations.
 
## 2.4 Parish Priest Responsibilities

### 2.4.1 Canon Law Obligations
A summary of Canon Law requirements in relation to the parish priest’s responsibilities of administration follows:
 
i. To act within the limits and manner of ordinary administration, except where the Archbishop’s written permission permits otherwise.  Without permission, the act is invalid.  (Cn. 1281, §1)

### 2.4.2 Media & Communications
The Parish Priest is the person authorised to communicate with the media in relation to parish matters.  Priests are encouraged to first check with the Archdiocese’s Director of Communications & Media to assist in ensuring the messaging is consistent and accurate.
 
Media interest in events and people can be generated for all sorts of reasons. In the main, it is usually good, but there may be times when it is both challenging and concerning for the parish community.  
Refer to the guidelines issued by the Archdiocese to parish priests for the handling of media enquiries

## 2.5 Parish Finance Committee
### 2.5.1 Introduction & Background
 
Each parish is required by the Code of Canon Law to have a Parish Finance Committee to assist the Parish Priest with their administrative duties.
 
Independent of the Parish Pastoral Council, which is concerned with the pastoral responsibilities of the parish, the Parish Finance Committee assists the Parish Priest with the administration of parish goods. The roles of these parish bodies are distinct, and each must be careful to protect its proper responsibilities should they collaborate together for any specific purpose.
 
The Parish Finance Committee is composed of parishioners who are chosen and appointed according to the Parish Finance Statutes issued by the Archbishop. This Handbook further specifies its role.
 
The Parish Finance Committee is a collaborative structure, consultative in nature and requires the presence of the Parish Priest for the validity of its proceedings.
 
The Church does not favour acts of financial administration by a single Parish Priest acting alone. This is particularly true where the Parish Priest is called upon to fulfil many other responsibilities.
 
The need for financial, civil law and canonical expertise is critical in a complex modern world. Where the relevant expertise cannot be found at parish level it will be necessary to draw on the expertise of the Archdiocesan Office whose financial officers are available to Parish Finance Committees.
 
### 2.5.2 Role of the Parish Finance Committee
 
The existence of the Finance Committee does not detract from the Parish Priest’s standing as the one who acts in the name of the Parish. However, such a Committee provides the Parish Priest with valuable insight and advice, so that he may act more effectively in the interests of the Parish.
 
The Committee should comprise a minimum of three members, not including the Parish Priest. The number of members should be commensurate with the size of the parish. Nevertheless it does not need to be large.
 
Careful adherence to any instructions issued by the Archbishop is required by Parish Priests and Finance Committees, especially in relation to transactions undertaken. If Archdiocesan policy and canon law requirements are not complied with, a particular transaction may be invalid under canon law and possibly under civil law as well
 
There are certain situations where Canon Law requires a Parish Priest to obtain the advice of the Parish Finance Committee.  If advice is required, the Parish Priest’s act is invalid if he does not hear the Committee. The Parish Priest is not bound to accept the Committee’s advice, even if unanimous; nevertheless, there must be some overriding reason for not doing so.
 
### 2.5.3 Responsibilities of the Parish Finance Committee
 
• Preparation of the parish budget of income and expenditure in accordance with the direction given by the Parish Priest. The Parish Priest, in consultation with the Parish Pastoral Council, should undertake a regular, if not annual, review of parish needs and priorities, and share their vision with the Parish Finance Committee
 
• Assist the parish priest in the preparation of suitable annual reports to the parishioners concerning parish finances by 31 March following the end of each calendar year.
 
• Assist the parish priest in the preparation of long term cash flow estimates to provide for future capital works and major maintenance requirements.
 
• Assist the parish priest in the preparation of an annual financial report to the Archbishop or providing access to the Archdiocesan Finance Office to the parish’s accounting application files by 31 March following the end of each calendar year.
 
• Call to the Parish Priest’s attention, any matters that seem to need more immediate action, such as:
o consistent over spending in a particular area of the budget; and
o any concerns for the long term financial welfare of the parish if it incurs an annual deficit, or if maintenance of adequate surplus funds appears to be in question.
 
• Assist the parish priest in ensuring that all regulatory requirements are complied with.
 
• Assist the parish priest in identifying and managing areas of risk to the financial viability of the parish.
 
• At meetings of the Parish Finance Committee the parish priest is to present the totals of income and expenditure since the last meeting and any significant facts relating to parish finances.
 
• Conduct a review of all parish insurance policies on renewal to ensure adequate insurance coverage exists.  All insurances are to be placed with Catholic Church Insurances Ltd.
 
• To ensure that prior to the purchase, sale or lease of property, the approval of the Archbishop is obtained according to the requirements of Parish Finance Committee Statutes.
 
### 2.5.4 Legal Liability of Parish Finance Committee Members
 
The members of the Finance Committee bear no civil legal responsibility by virtue of their membership. This is because of the nature of ecclesial governance and the way in which such governance is organised with respect to civil law.  A “Parish” is a canonical entity (public juridic person), not a civil legal entity.   As a required advisory body in canon law, it is not a Board of Management in the civil sphere, and is not civilly responsible at law.  
 
The Parish Priest, by virtue of his appointment by the Archbishop is the person in Church law responsible for the temporal goods and finances of the parish.  The Trustee Corporation is the civil legal entity that holds legal title in property held by the parish.
 
In all matters of legislative compliance that pertain to the parish, particularly in regard to its registration with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profit Commission, the “Responsible Person” listed is the Parish Priest and never members of the Parish Finance Committee.
 
This places special responsibility on the Parish Priest to seek advice wisely for as he bears legal responsibility for the temporal affairs of the parish.  This places a serious moral responsibility on the members of the Finance Committee to provide wise and honest advice on such matters.
 
Parish Priests and Parish Finance Committee members have the benefit of a Directors and Officers Liability insurance master policy arranged through the Archdiocese.  See 3.8 Insurance for more details on insurance cover.
 
## 2.6 Parish Canonical Visitation
### 2.6.1 ​Archbishop’s Responsibility
 
A bishop is obliged to visit parishes in his diocese, such that he visits the entire diocese at least every five years either personally or through an auxiliary bishop, the vicar general, or an episcopal vicar (can 396).
 
Add brief description of the process for parishes in CAM

### 2.6.2 Annual Financial Report Review
 
The Archdiocese does not require parishes to audit their financial statements.  Instead, the Finance Office and/or the Parish Support Office review the financial report submitted by the parish in order to provide feedback & support to the parish and advice to the Archbishop as required.  
 
It is preferred that the parish supplies the above offices with access to the accounting package data file so that a review of the records may be conducted and extra support and advice provided to the parish where necessary.  This may be particularly helpful for parishes in reconciling balances related to ongoing tax remittance obligations (eg: PAYGW and GST) to their ATO running balance account records.
