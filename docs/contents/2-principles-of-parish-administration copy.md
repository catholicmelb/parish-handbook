# 2. Principles of Parish Administration

## 2.1 General Principles

### 2.1.1 The Person in Charge of Administration
 
The general principle is that the Bishop is responsible for the administration of a diocese, and the Parish Priest is responsible for the administration of a parish.  The Bishop may entrust the administration of the parish to another person who is not a Priest, but must appoint a priest to be ultimately responsible for the pastoral care of the parish.  

The Bishop is responsible for administering the goods belonging to the diocese while the Parish Administrator is responsible for those belonging to the parish.  

The Bishop is to supervise carefully the administration of all the goods which belong to the parishes, and to ensure the effective administration of church goods by issuing Parish Finance Committee Statutes.

### 2.1.2 Summary of Canons and Respective Roles
 
It is the responsibility of the Bishop to supervise carefully the administration of all goods that belong to parishes of the Diocese (canon 1276, §1).
 
In attending to this responsibility, the Bishop issues special instructions for administration of church goods and property (canon 1276, §2).  
 
The parish priest is the administrator of the assets of the parish (canon 532).  He is to carry out this task of administration in accord with the norms of canons 1281-1288.  In place of a parish priest, the Bishop may appoint a parish administrator.  All the financial responsibilities of a parish priest apply equally to parish administrators, with the proviso that no changes take place, which would prejudice the rights of a subsequently appointed parish priest.  References to parish priests in this Handbook, includes reference to parish administrators where appointed.
 
Canon 537 makes it obligatory that there be a finance committee in each parish to assist the parish priest in regard to his responsibilities for financial and administrative matters.
 
The existence of the finance committee does not detract from the parish priest’s standing as the one who acts in the name of the parish (canon 532).  However, such a Committee provides the parish priest with valuable insight and advice, so that he may act more effectively in the interests of the parish.
 
Careful adherence to any instructions issued by the Archbishop is required by parish priests and finance committees. If Diocesan policy and Canon Law requirements are not complied with, a particular transaction may be invalid under Canon Law and possibly under civil law as well.
 
There are certain situations where Canon Law, through the norms issued by the local bishop, requires a parish priest to consult with and obtain the advice of the Parish Finance Committee (PFC).  The parish priest is not bound in any way to accept the Committee’s advice, even if unanimous; nevertheless, there must be some overriding reason for not doing so.


## 2.2 Acts of Parish Administration


### 2.2.1 Canon Law Summary

The Church holds and administers temporal goods to serve the mission that the Lord has entrusted to the Church.  The first point, which should be kept in mind, therefore, is that Church property never belongs to an individual person as if it were his or her own personal property.  Church property always belongs to some juridic person and is the concern of the Christian community.  
 
The canonical norms, therefore, structure the Church’s administration of property to facilitate the Church’s mission, to protect the rights of various Christian communities to the proper use of property entrusted to them and to promote the welfare of those persons and groups who should benefit from the wise use of the goods, which are made available to the Church
 
Canon law states four broad purposes for Church property:
• pursuit of divine worship;
• support for clerics and other ministers;
• performance of the apostolic works proper to the Church; and
• works of charity, especially concern for the needy (c.1254, §2).
 

Canon Law distinguishes two types of acts of administration in relation to parishes:
• acts of ordinary administration, and
• acts of extraordinary administration.
 
In addition, there are specific Canon Law requirements in relation to:
• the alienation (transfer of ownership) of property, and
• the leasing out of parish goods.
 

### 2.2.2 Ordinary Administration

Acts of ordinary administration are transactions and expenditures considered necessary for the daily and routine operation and maintenance of the property or work of the parish.  This can include the following:
 
• Maintenance of church buildings;
• Payment of salaries and taxes;
• Acceptance of ordinary donations;
• Replacement of equipment and furniture and
• Collection of debts, rents and interest.
 
The parish priest (incl. administrator) does not require authorisation, or the advice or consent of others (e.g. Parish Finance Committee or Bishop) to carry out such acts.  However, with some decisions he may choose to seek advice from the Parish Finance Committee.  
 

### 2.2.3 Extraordinary Administration

Acts that are not acts of ordinary administration are considered to be acts of extraordinary administration.  These acts require the parish priest to consult with the Parish Finance Committee and seek the Bishop’s approval before proceeding.
 
All correspondence to the Archbishop or the Diocesan Executive Director Stewardship’s office relating to consultations with, or the work of, the Parish Finance Committee must be signed by the Parish Priest.
 
The Archbishop has determined in accordance with canon 1281, §2, that the acts listed below are acts of extraordinary administration:
 
• Capital works and major refurbishment on a single project expenditure exceeding $100,000 for Parish projects and Primary School projects and $300,000 for Secondary Colleges must be submitted to the Archbishop for his approval through the Planning, Building & Finance Committee.  (Note that Melbourne Archdiocese Catholic Schools Ltd will submit the requests for approval of primary school and college projects).

• Sale & purchase of land;
• Other acts of alienation of a parish’s stable patrimony (property & fixed assets) where the value (not the sale price) is above the minimum amount published in the norms issued by the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference.  As at June 2022, acts of alienation in excess of $33,921 require the approval of the Archbishop;
• Leasing of property and buildings for terms greater than 3 years;
• Adopting an “indemnity only” basis for insurance of parish buildings (ie: insurance cover is limited to the cost of removal / demolition of the insured building)
• Formation of any civil incorporation, or participation in any civil incorporation other than the “Roman Catholic Trusts Corporation for the Diocese of Melbourne”;
• Initiating or contesting litigation in a civil forum in the name of a public juridic person (Parish or Archdiocese);
• Acceptance or refusal of bequests to which are attached some qualifying obligation or condition;
• Any borrowings outside of CDF & any borrowings with CDF >$100,000; and
• Establishing investments of parish reserves > $100,000 outside of CDF.
 
For the above acts the parish priest must first consult the members of the Parish Finance Committee.  The parish priest must ensure the members are fully informed before convening the Committee.
 
Following consultation with the Parish Finance Committee, the parish priest must seek written permission from the Archbishop for such acts of Extraordinary Administration.  The opinion of the Committee must be relayed to Archbishop in the request for permission.
 
Before the Archbishop provides written approval, he may be required to seek the advice of the College of Consultors and/or the Diocesan Finance Committee.
 
### 2.2.4 Alienation
Alienation, simply defined, is the transfer of assets or rights over assets from one person to another with or without compensation.  Normally, this will be through the sale or gifting of assets.  Acts such as mortgaging, renting, or leasing of property are not acts of alienation, however, these transactions themselves may constitute acts of extraordinary administration and therefore require consent and approvals as noted above. The concept behind alienation, is that goods constituting the stable patrimony of the parish (ie: of the juridic person) are destined to remain in the possession of the church for a long or indefinite period of time, in order to provide security for the future through the preservation of value (canon 1294 §1 & §2).
 
A typical example would involve the sale of property and investment of the sale proceeds. Additionally, interest earned on the investment should be reinvested (to the value of inflation) so as to maintain the real value of the asset.  If the purchasing value is not maintained against inflation, it cannot be said that the future benefit has been preserved.  Utilisation of sale proceeds of a property should not be applied to the general maintenance of other properties, as distinctions between items of capital (assets and liabilities) and revenue (income and expenses) need to be drawn.
 
This is not to say that permission to utilise the proceeds will be unreasonably withheld, providing it can be demonstrated that the capital is being converted into another asset.
 
It is the Archdiocese’s policy that the proceeds from the sale of real property and long term investment assets, not otherwise applied to purchase replacement assets, be lodged with the Catholic Development Fund.  Investment of sale proceeds outside of the CDF require the permission of the Archbishop in accordance with the prescribed norms in the PFC Statutes.  The purchase of replacement assets may constitute an act of extraordinary administration thus requiring its own approval per section 2.2.3 Extraordinary Administration
 
It is most important that the intentions of the donors of goods to the parish are respected when a decision is made to alienate such goods (canon 1300).  It may be prudent to consult with the donor, or their representative(s) to ensure their original bequest/donation intentions are not contravened.
 
Specific permissions are required whenever the value of goods being alienated exceeds the sum determined by law (canon 1291). In November 1984 the Australian Catholic Bishops’ Conference determined the minimum and maximum sums in relation to alienation and confirmed that:
• Proposed acts of alienation by a parish in excess of the minimum sum require the Archbishop to obtain the consent of the Diocesan Finance Committee, the College of Consultors and other interested parties prior to giving permission for the alienation; and
• Where such proposed acts are in excess of the maximum sum, the Archbishop must also seek the permission of the Holy See (canon 1292, §2)
 
The minimum and maximum sums are indexed at 30 June each year in accordance with the Consumer Price Index.  For the current amounts refer to Appendix 1 - Amounts for alienation of temporal goods.
 
### 2.2.5 Leases
In November 1984 the Australian Catholic Bishops’ Conference further determined when the leasing out of parish assets required special permissions in accordance with Canon 1297:
 
• For leases for periods in excess of nine (9) years, the same permissions as for acts of extraordinary administration are required; and
 
• For leases for periods greater than three (3) years but less than nine (9) years, the parish priest/administrator requires the consent of the Archbishop after having consulted the Parish Finance Committee.   The Bishop may consult the Diocesan Finance Council and the College of Consultors.
 
In addition, the Archbishop has determined that for leases for periods of three (3) years or less that the parish priest must consult the Parish Finance Committee.  
 
### 2.2.6 Invalid Acts of Administration
Parish priests act invalidly if they perform acts of extraordinary administration without prior written permission of the Archbishop (canon 1281, §1).  Without this permission, the action is invalid at Canon Law and may also be invalid from a civil law standpoint.
