# Foreword

‘But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.’ (1 Corinthians 14:40)

Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,

Our parishes are at the frontline of the mission of the Church, where we draw near to Christ most particularly in the sacraments. They are where our communities form and flourish, and where we learn to be servants of the Gospel in the world. To do this, we need to make good use of all the gifts God has given us.

The world we are in today, however, places many challenges on parish life and increasing demands on clergy and parish staff in undertaking daily administrative responsibilities. These demands can draw activities away from the key pastoral and spiritual endeavours that are the bedrock of our parish and faith life. 

For each parish, the responsibility for the good management of the community’s resources lies with the parish priest or administrator, with the assistance and strong collaboration of the parish finance committee. 

For this reason, we have released this *Parish Administration Handbook*, together with the issuance of new Parish Finance Committee Statutes. These user-friendly resources and information will guide and support the provision of the highest standards in financial accountability and management of risks for parishes in the Archdiocese of Melbourne.

The *Handbook* contains administrative and finance-related policies and is designed not just to assist with the many aspects of parish administration, but also to provide confidence to parishioners, committee members and clergy alike, that parish goods and patrimony are well administered. 

It is intended this *Handbook* should be a ‘living’ document, so there will be amendments, additions and changes as the occasion demands. I trust that it will be a valuable tool for clergy and parishes in administering the goods that have been entrusted to them. I offer my gratitude to those who have brought the information together, and commend this *Parish Administration Handbook* as an excellent resource to assist in the leadership of the parish.
