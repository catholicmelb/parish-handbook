## What is the handbook?

The parish has long been a place of gathering for the community of God’s faithful. Under the pastoral care of their parish priest, the parish is a place of worship where the community gathers for the Eucharist and the celebration of the sacraments. Pope Francis reminds us that the parish is ‘the presence of the Church in a given territory, an environment for hearing God’s word, for growth in the Christian life, for dialogue, proclamation, charitable outreach, worship and celebration’. (*Evangelii Gaudium*, n.28)

The word “parish" comes from the Greek word, *paroikos*, which means “sojourner”. And so it is that the parish is a community of sojourners – a ‘sanctuary where the thirsty come to drink in the midst of their journey, and a centre of constant missionary outreach’. (n.28) 

But while it is a gathering place for God’s faithful, we know that the life of a parish is not to look inward, but rather to equip its people to live out their baptismal call to go out into the world as bearers of Christ’s love and witnesses to the Gospel.

To be effective in its mission, a parish must make good use of the gifts and resources it has been entrusted with. This *Parish Administration Handbook* contains guidelines on parish administration and management, including the administration of parish goods. These guidelines should be viewed as a minimum for each parish to follow and read in conjunction with the Parish Finance Committee Statutes of the Archdiocese of Melbourne and the *Code of Canon Law*.

## How to use this *Handbook*

The *Parish Administration Handbook* integrates a wide range of resources, guides, manuals and other publications to offer a single, comprehensive source of information on Archdiocesan administrative policies and procedures. 

Each chapter contains information pertaining to a particular aspect of the administration and management of a parish, with links to helpful documents and forms which pastors and parish leadership teams can use to carry out their roles.
